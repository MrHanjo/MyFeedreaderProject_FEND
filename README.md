About this:

The page is essentially a list of article links with a popout menu that can be click-activated to reveal another list of links.  This was a class project 
for Udacity.  This projects simulates a webpage that was created and handed off to me to create a testing environment for. 

The tests I have created ensure that the arrays of links are properly populated with no errors of repetition and no empty arrays.  There is also
a test that ensures the popout menu can properly be toggled on and off at every click.

The testing framework used to test this page's javascript is Jasmine (version 2.1.x).
Visit the site, https://jasmine.github.io for more information.
You can find the feedreader test code in the javascript file located in, /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js

Currently the page is fully functional with all tests passing (September 2018).


Further Testing:

A potential future test might involve assuring that the links go to a working webpage and if not to disclude them from the arrays.  Then run 
a test to ensure that the removal worked.


Quickstart:

You can simply open the index.html file in a browser and the jasmine test results are revealed at the bottom.

This project was written by the staff at Udacity and edited by myself, Mike Ahn to simulate an unfinished testing environment handoff.
